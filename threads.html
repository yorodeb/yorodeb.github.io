				<h2>TRAP ME!
					<h3><time datetime = "2025-09-08">September 07, 2025</time></h3>
				</h2>
				<p>
				I wish to be perpetually ensnared, an eternal fixture, undisturbed by the clamor of the world. My desire is for a state of absolute nothingness -- a void where no external force can compel me and no internal impulse can stir me from my tranquility.

				<p>
				Foolish mortal still clicking icons? I sculpt code with Neovim, keys dancing like skeletal fingers on a moonlit grave. Your IDE? A bloated corpse. Mine? A lean, mean spectral editor. While you fumble, I’m three commits ahead, laughing in the dark. Enjoy your GUI training wheels. The abyss awaits us all, but I'll reach it with superior keyboard shortcuts.

				<h2>Frank Reynolds.
					<h3><time datetime = "2025-06-14">June 14, 2025</time></h3>
				</h2>
				<p>
				Frank Reynolds: A feral goblin of a man, perpetually emerging from the depths of a sofa or sewer grate. He's a depraved capitalist, a master of dumpster diving, and a connoisseur of morally bankrupt schemes. His life's philosophy boils down to "I just want to be pure," usually before doing something utterly grotesque. A true testament to humanity's baser instincts.
