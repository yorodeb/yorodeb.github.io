				<h2>The Art of Procastination: Masterclass</h2>
				<h3>Have you ever wondered how to make the least of your time?</h3>
				<p>
				Konnichiwa! Yorokobi-San here, sharing my mastery of procrastination. Forget time management; this is time mismanagement as high art. I excel at "pre-preparation" (like endless desktop tidying) and "quick social media checks" (that last hours). My best work? 2 AM, fueled by panic. I've truly Let Go!

				<h2>The FuckUp's Manifesto</h2>
				<p>
				My adult life? A masterclass in procrastination. That "academic leverage" is just my self-sabotage playing out. Exams hit in four days. FOUR. FUCKING. DAYS. I'm busy dissecting Patrick Bateman's routine, while trying to perfectly learn and... not learn. After this, I'll still wonder "What went wrong?!" The answer: I didn't study. I get it now. This post will conclude. Promise. I'll report back after the weekend (if I survive). COP

				<h2>You know I'm better. Cause I'm a NeoVimmer!</h2>
				<p>
				Foolish mortal still clicking icons? I sculpt code with Neovim, keys dancing like skeletal fingers on a moonlit grave. Your IDE? A bloated corpse. Mine? A lean, mean spectral editor. While you fumble, I’m three commits ahead, laughing in the dark. Enjoy your GUI training wheels. The abyss awaits us all, but I'll reach it with superior keyboard shortcuts.

				<h2>Frank Reynolds.</h2>
				<p>
				Frank Reynolds: A feral goblin of a man, perpetually emerging from the depths of a sofa or sewer grate. He's a depraved capitalist, a master of dumpster diving, and a connoisseur of morally bankrupt schemes. His life's philosophy boils down to "I just want to be pure," usually before doing something utterly grotesque. A true testament to humanity's baser instincts.
