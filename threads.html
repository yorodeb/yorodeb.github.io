				<h2>The F*-Up's Manifesto</h2>
				<p>
				Look, I've been a world-class procrastinator for most of my adult life. And it's not for lack of trying to fix it. That "academic leverage" I mentioned? It's just a fancy term for how my reckless, self-sabotaging behavior actually plays out.

				My End Semester Exams are in four days. Four. Days. FOUR FUCKING DAY. Right now, I'm trying to figure out what was <b><i>Patrick Bateman's</i></b> workout routine and what is the perfect way to learn and, simultaneously, not learning. The really messed up part is, after all this, I'll still probably stare blankly and wonder, "What went wrong?!" And the brutal, obvious answer will be: I didn't study.

				Well, I finally get it. This blog post will actually have a real conclusion, unlike most of my efforts. That's a promise to myself, and to you, my silent, judging reader. After a couple of weekends (assuming I survive this one), I'll tell you exactly how this whole approach worked out. Identifying Code: $COP$

				<h2>The Art of Procastination: Masterclass</h2>
				<h3>Have you ever wondered how to make the least of your time?</h3>
				<p>
				Konnichiwa! Yorokobi-San here, sharing my mastery of procrastination. Forget time management; this is time mismanagement as high art. I excel at "pre-preparation" (like endless desktop tidying) and "quick social media checks" (that last hours). My best work? 2 AM, fueled by panic. I've truly Let Go!

				<h2>You know I'm better. Cause I'm a NeoVimmer!</h2>
				<p>
				Foolish mortal still clicking icons? I sculpt code with Neovim, keys dancing like skeletal fingers on a moonlit grave. Your IDE? A bloated corpse. Mine? A lean, mean spectral editor. While you fumble, I’m three commits ahead, laughing in the dark. Enjoy your GUI training wheels. The abyss awaits us all, but I'll reach it with superior keyboard shortcuts.

				<h2>Frank Reynolds.</h2>
				<p>
				Frank Reynolds: A feral goblin of a man, perpetually emerging from the depths of a sofa or sewer grate. He's a depraved capitalist, a master of dumpster diving, and a connoisseur of morally bankrupt schemes. His life's philosophy boils down to "I just want to be pure," usually before doing something utterly grotesque. A true testament to humanity's baser instincts.
