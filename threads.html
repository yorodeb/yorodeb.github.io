				<h2>Bye Superman!
					<h3><time datetime = "2025-07-20">July 20, 2025</time></h3>
				</h2>
				<p>
				A fictional character first came to life in 1938 on the pages of Action
				Comics #1: an archetype who wears an outlandish costume, has a
				codename, extraordinary abilities, and an altruistic mission. He's a
				starman, sent here to preserve humanity.

				While that sounds like utter bullshit propaganda spread to mollify the
				general populance, I have to admit it's true. Because he's better
				than a saviour – he's a human. Not more alien than me or you? Why, you
				ask? Because he cares, he loves, and he attends to his ablutions
				(LOL!). That's what makes him special, what makes him ours, what makes
				him incredibly easy to love. He's Superman! The best of all of us, the best of all humanity
				can offer. Anyone can be Superman because we are already a part of him;
				our love, passion, hate, fears, and idiosyncrasies make this 'man'
				'super' – it's a matter of attention and empathy.

				My Superman walked in with a hiking bag and spectacles on. A muscular
				bloke with an ample frame. His eyes were and still are full of hope, so
				much so that it's hard to face them (with my degrading-self). I would not
				like to romanticize this weirdo anymore, because he's pretty good at
				that himself – someone might even say "over-romanticizing" himself. Well, I'm
				here to announce that I'm letting my Superman go; I'm letting him go
				for good. I don't know what the world holds for me or him, but all I
				have is this image of my bruv, sparkling like a star in a crowd of
				millions. And some amount of courage is bestowed by him. I'm scared and
				I'm sad about losing him, but that's what makes me human, and that's
				what makes us Superman!

				To Mr. CEO, At last we'll meet someday. Hopefully then I'll be able to
				catch the unbounded, infinite love and appreciation you have for yours
				truly.

				<h2>You know I'm better. Cause I'm a NeoVimmer!
					<h3><time datetime = "2025-06-16">June 16, 2025</time></h3>
				</h2>
				<p>
				Foolish mortal still clicking icons? I sculpt code with Neovim, keys dancing like skeletal fingers on a moonlit grave. Your IDE? A bloated corpse. Mine? A lean, mean spectral editor. While you fumble, I’m three commits ahead, laughing in the dark. Enjoy your GUI training wheels. The abyss awaits us all, but I'll reach it with superior keyboard shortcuts.

				<h2>Frank Reynolds.
					<h3><time datetime = "2025-06-14">June 14, 2025</time></h3>
				</h2>
				<p>
				Frank Reynolds: A feral goblin of a man, perpetually emerging from the depths of a sofa or sewer grate. He's a depraved capitalist, a master of dumpster diving, and a connoisseur of morally bankrupt schemes. His life's philosophy boils down to "I just want to be pure," usually before doing something utterly grotesque. A true testament to humanity's baser instincts.
