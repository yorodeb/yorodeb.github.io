		<h2>What is Pluto?</h2>
		<p>
		Pluto is a metasyntactic variable, a placeholder name used in programming and technical documentation. It's often used alongside other placeholder names like foo and bar to represent a value or entity without giving it a specific, meaningful name. This helps in providing generic examples and avoiding confusion with real data or variables.
