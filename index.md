Konnichiwa! Allow me to introduce myself as [Yorokobi-San][0], my chosen mantle for this boundless digital realm. I traverse the hallowed halls of a most unassuming university—a place, I confess, far better suited for the harmonious inclinations of Homo sapiens than for an eccentric aberration such as yours truly. My present existence is burdened by an academic ledger that speaks volumes of a dreadful past, yet my future remains shadowed by the ineffable specter of profound failure. The latent power of my prefrontal cortex, alas, remains utterly immeasurable, precisely because its vast capabilities have, until now, been so woefully underutilized! (A chuckle, perhaps, at my own expense). Let this digital proclamation stand as both a solemn warning and a resonant declaration to the entire sphere: "The binds are severed! I have irrevocably Let Go!"

Enthrallment
